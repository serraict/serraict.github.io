[Kanban in Action][safari-books] is a great introduction to Kanban for readers who want to get to know Kanban quickly an immediately apply it - like myself. It will explain Kanban, its background and presents tools and visualization techniques to help your team organize their work.

The authors [Marcus Hammarberg] and [Joakim Sundén] do this by telling how they helped the fictive team "the Kanbaneros" learn Kanban to manage their work.

Personally, I am not a big fan of the story-telling approach, however it *does* help to get the point across and as such this book is helpful. It stays true to the Kanban principles and I can map the stories of the "Kanbaneros" to my context.

I'd recommend this book to everyone starting with Kanban, or helping a team to start with Kanban.

#### My three take-aways:

Foundations of Kanban:

 * Start from where you are now
 * Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
 * Respect people and current process, roles, responsibilities and titles

Core Principles:

 * Visualize the work
 * Limit work in progress
 * Manage flow

> Stop starting, start finishing.
