Another interesting part of this post is Erik's rant on Agile and Scrum.
I hope I can enable some Hacker Spirit in the development teams I serve.
Personally, I see lots of overlap in good Scrum and Erik's "Hacker Way" values.

This is a problem that might not exist. A Heisenproblem!

It would be interesting to compare these values to "good" Scrum;
that is an incarnation of Scrum that breaths the Scrum values of
courage, respect, commitment, focus and openness.
