  <p>
    You can hire me as an Agile Coach or Scrum Master to serve-slash-lead your Scrum team, take your agile teams to the next level and help your organization adapt to agile software delivery.
    I am a PSM II certified Scrum Master and a certified Professional Scrum Practicioner.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point in time, my professional focus is on coaching and guiding software teams, but I do like to deliver value as an agile developer from time to time.
    I am a professional Scrum developer, comfortable in .NET, JavaScript and Python. As a developer, I am a critical, analytical and creative team player with a passion for high quality code, automated testing and writing documentation.

  <h1>
    Marijn van der Zee.
    <small>That's me!</small>
  </h1>
  <p>
    I love to guide software teams on their journey to deliver valuable software and becoming a great team.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a Scrum Master, agile developer, pragmatic student, team player and coach and have been active in the field of software development for well over ten years.
  </p>
  <p>
    I work in an open and transparent way, 
        sometimes confronting,
        but always respectful towards people 
        and with the organization's goals in mind. 

        I think I'm skillful and knowledgeable, 
        yet I continuously find 
        that there are better ways to go about my work
        and that there still is much to learn.
