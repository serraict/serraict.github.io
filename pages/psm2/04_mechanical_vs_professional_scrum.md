### Mechanical vs Professional Scrum

> Explain the difference between “Mechanical” Scrum and “Professional” Scrum

I'm not fully aware of these terms, so let me define them first:

Mechanical Scrum: an adaptation of Scrum, where the team and organization
has implemented Scrum by the book; they do all the events, 
have assigned all the roles and deliver a working increment every sprint.

Professional Scrum: an adaptation of Scrum that 
(might have started out as Mechanical Scrum and) 
has led the team and organization 
to discover the values and principles of Scrum
and thereby
to continuously improve their product and process
to better and quicker serve their users and customers,
and to a more joyous and innovative work space.

In mechanical scrum, the team and organization go through the motions 
(of Scrum, of their respective context)
but don't utilize the transparency Scrum provides 
wrt their own work and context
to improve it 
by addressing the most important issues.
This aspect of Scrum can be hard and it 
takes courage, perseverance and discipline
that not all teams and organizations have.

In my opinion, 
this courage, perseverance and discipline 
to inspect the tough problems and adapt to them 
is what shows the truly professional Scrum Team.
