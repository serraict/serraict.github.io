Hey Scrum Master!

 * Are you growing in your Scrum Master role 
   and want to explore product delivery within and beyond 
   the boundaries provided by Scrum?
 * Do you consider taking an advanced Scrum Master certification exam 
   such as [PSM2] or even [PSM3]?
 * Did you attempt an advanced Scrum Master exam, 
   but did not pass and you want to learn why?
 * Do you want to explore Scrum beyond the letter of the law in the Scrum Guide?

Then this Scrum study group I'm hosting might be something for you.

### What can you expect to get from this group

Well facilitated, online learning sessions.

Guidance from an experienced Scrum Master ([me]).

An open and constructive learning environment, 
focused on your learning experience.

Constructive feedback from me as well as from your peers.

Experienced and knowledgeable peer participants.

### What _NOT_ to expect from this group

This study group is _not_ affiliated with 
[Scrum.org], [Scrum Alliance], [Scrum Inc] 
or any other certification body.

You do _not_ get a free exam when participating in this group.

I am _not_ a professional Scrum trainer.

This group will _not_ provide you with answers to all of your questions. 

### Session outline & Logistics

Each group will participate in 3 to 5 sessions, 
depending on the needs of the group.

In this study group we will create and publish our own 
Advanced Scrum Master Exam; one that reflects our learning journey.
After each session we will release a new increment of our exam.

The first session will focus 
on the boundaries Scrum provides
and how these can enhance agility.
We'll pay special attention to the use of language, 
the Scrum values and the principles underlying Scrum.

We'll adapt the content of subsequent sessions to the needs of the group.

You need to prepare for each session.
Expect one hour preparation time per session.

All sessions will be online. 
You need a decent laptop and a good internet connection to participate. 
We'll use [Zoom.us], [Google Forms] and [Mural].
All are free of charge for you, 
since I'll be hosting the session from my paid accounts.

We'll run at least one session per week.
